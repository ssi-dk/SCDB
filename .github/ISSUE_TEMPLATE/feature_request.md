<!-- 
	Thank you for your interest in improving the SCDB package!
	In order to more easily identify feature requests which may be arbitrarily old, please give a very brief explanation of the feature in the title.

	For example (inspired by previously added features):

	* Support for SQLite
	* Testing with a Postgres container in GitHub Actions
	* Refactor the Logger instance to a separace object
	
	If your feature is simple and you already have a fork implementing this feature, feel free to skip this issue and open a pull request instead!

**Describe the feature**
<!--
	What is this feature supposed to do?

-->

**What use will this feature have?**
<!-- 
	Does the feature improve user-friendliness?
	Does it address compatibility or security issues?
	Does it provide significant performance improvements?
-->

**Who should add the feature?**
<!--
	Is this something you are willing to add yourself, or do you need help with anything?
